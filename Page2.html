<ul><h1>The first computer, the ENIAC, was completed in 1945</h1></ul>
<h2><footer>The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), completed in 1945, was one of the first general-purpose electronic digital computers. 
It was capable of performing complex calculations much faster than any mechanical computer of its time, using over 17,000 vacuum tubes. 
ENIAC could solve a variety of problems, from artillery firing tables to weather predictions, and was a major milestone in the development of modern computing.</footer></h2>
<ul><h1>The development of the transistor in 1947 revolutionized electronics.</h1></ul>
<h2><footer>In 1947, the development of the transistor by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Labs revolutionized electronics. Unlike vacuum tubes, transistors were smaller, more reliable, energy-efficient, and could be mass-produced at a lower cost. 
This breakthrough paved the way for the miniaturization of electronic devices, leading to the development of modern computers, smartphones, and countless other technologies.</footer></h2>
<ul><h1>The first microprocessor was created by Intel in 1971.</h1></ul>
<h2><footer>In 1971, Intel introduced the first microprocessor, the Intel 4004. It was a 4-bit processor and integrated all the functions of a computerâ€™s central processing unit (CPU) into a single chip, making it a groundbreaking innovation. 
The Intel 4004 laid the foundation for the development of personal computers and modern computing as we know it today.</footer></h2>
